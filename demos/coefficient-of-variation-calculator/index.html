<p>
	The coefficient of variation, denoted by the two letters, \( CV \), is the ratio of the standard deviation \( \sigma \) to the mean, \( \mu \).
</p>

<p>The coefficient of variation is a dimensionless number (i.e. it has no units) and indicates how spread out numbers are in a set of data, relative to the mean. It is particularly useful compared to the standard deviation when comparing the spread of sets which may have different units or different means.</p>

<p>
	It is calculated using the following equation: 
</p>

\[ CV = \frac{\sigma}{\mu} \]

<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>
	Firstly, the standard deviation, \( \sigma \), is calculated. You can read more about how standard deviation is calculated on our <a href="/demos/standard-deviation-calculator/">standard deviation calculator</a> page.
</p>


<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>	
	Next, you need to calculate the mean, \( \mu \). This is done by adding up all of the numbers and then dividing by the number of numbers, \( N \). 
</p>


<h3>Step 3</h3>

<p>
	Finally, you divide the standard deviation by the mean.
